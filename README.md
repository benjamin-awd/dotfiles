# Dotfiles
Lightweight dotfiles managed with [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

# Setup
To install `brew` and `chezmoi`, run this script: 
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjamin-awd/dotfiles/main/init.sh)"
```
The script will also run `chezmoi apply`, which will install brew packages and dotfiles.
